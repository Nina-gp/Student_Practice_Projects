# Merge Sort Project

This is my one of my **first semester university projects** where I tried implementing the **Merge Sort algorithm** in C++.

## About the Project

Merge Sort is a classic algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into halves, sorting each half, and then merging them back together.
This project is just a simple console program that:

- Asks the user for the size of an array
- Takes input numbers from the user
- Shows the array **before sorting**
- Sorts the array using **Merge Sort**
- Shows the array **after sorting**

## How to Run

1. Compile the code with any C++ compiler, for example:
   ```bash
   g++ merge_sort.cpp -o MergeSort
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./MergeSort
   ```
3. Enter the array size and elements as prompted.

## Example

```
Enter size of array:
5
Enter 5 integers in any order:
8 3 7 1 2
Before Sorting:
8 3 7 1 2
After Sorting:
1 2 3 7 8
```

## Notes

- This is my **first C++ sorting project**.
- The goal here was to learn **arrays, recursion, and basic algorithms**.
