# MagicSquareProject

**Description:**  
First semester university project. Implements a magic square generator using the Siamese method in C++. This was my first attempt at writing more complex algorithms as a beginner student.

## Features
- Generates a magic square for odd-sized matrices
- Prints the resulting square in a readable format

## Note
This project reflects my first programming experience at university. The code works correctly but is written in a straightforward “student style” for learning purposes.

## Usage
1. Compile the code with any C++ compiler:
```bash
g++ MagicSquareProject.cpp -o MagicSquareProject
```
2. Run the executable and follow the instructions to input an odd number `n`:
```bash
./MagicSquareProject
```
3. The program will display the generated magic square.
