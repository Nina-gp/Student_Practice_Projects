# Student Practice Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of simple, student-level programming exercises. The main goal of these projects is to practice programming concepts and numerical methods, not to create production-ready code. These projects reflect beginner-level coding style and are meant for learning purposes.

## Projects Included

### 1. Merge Sort
**Description:**
A classic implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C++. It demonstrates the divide-and-conquer method for sorting arrays.

**Input:**
- Size of the array
- Array elements (integers)

**Output:**
- Sorted array

**Purpose:**
- Practice recursion and array manipulation.

---

### 2. Magic Square
**Description:**
Generates a magic square for odd-sized matrices using a student-style algorithm. The sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

**Input:**
- Size of the square (odd number)

**Output:**
- Printed magic square matrix

**Purpose:**
- Practice loops, conditionals, and 2D arrays.

---

### 3. Champagne Tower
**Description:**
Simulates the champagne tower problem. It calculates the amount of liquid in a specific glass after pouring a certain total amount.

**Input:**
- Total poured amount (float)
- Row number
- Glass number in that row

**Output:**
- Amount in the specified glass

**Purpose:**
- Practice arrays, nested loops, and simple simulation logic.

---

### 4. Numerical Analysis Exercise (Pi and e)
**Description:**
A Python program that approximates Pi and Euler's number to 4 decimal places and demonstrates basic error propagation rules.

**Input:**
- None (values are calculated internally)

**Output:**
- Approximated values
- Absolute errors
- Checks for error propagation rules

**Purpose:**
- Learn about numerical approximations and error analysis in a student-friendly way.

**Note:**
These exercises are intended for learning purposes. Do not treat them as professional code. They reflect a beginner's perspective and are useful for practicing basic programming and numerical analysis concepts.
