# Student Practice Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of simple, student-level programming exercises. The main goal of these projects is to practice programming concepts and numerical methods, not to create production-ready code. These projects reflect beginner-level coding style and are meant for learning purposes.

## Projects Included

### 1. Merge Sort
**Description:**
A classic implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C++. It demonstrates the divide-and-conquer method for sorting arrays.

**Purpose:**
- Practice recursion and array manipulation.

---

### 2. Magic Square
**Description:**
Generates a magic square for odd-sized matrices using a student-style algorithm. The sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

**Purpose:**
- Practice loops, conditionals, and 2D arrays.

---

### 3. Champagne Tower
**Description:**
Simulates the champagne tower problem. It calculates the amount of liquid in a specific glass after pouring a certain total amount.

**Purpose:**
- Practice arrays, nested loops, and simple simulation logic.

---

### 4. Numerical Analysis Exercise (Pi and e)
**Description:**
A Python program that approximates Pi and Euler's number to 4 decimal places and demonstrates basic error propagation rules.

**Purpose:**
- Learn about numerical approximations and error analysis in a student-friendly way.

---

### 5. Jacobi Iterative Method (Linear System Solver)

**Description:**
Python program to solve ( Ax = b ) using the **Jacobi iterative method** for 6×6 and 13×13 matrices.

**Purpose:**
Practice **Numerical Linear Algebra**: iterative methods, convergence, and error control.

---

### 6. Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Method (Linear System Solver)

**Description:**
Python program to solve ( Ax = b ) using the **SOR iterative method** with optimal relaxation factor ((\omega)) for tridiagonal, symmetric, positive definite matrices.

**Purpose:**
Practice **Numerical Linear Algebra**: relaxation methods and faster convergence.

**Note:**
These exercises are intended for learning purposes. Do not treat them as professional code. They reflect a beginner's perspective and are useful for practicing basic programming and numerical analysis concepts.
